This project is not requires any package or library or framework, so it is just pure python code

The project is a gui app that takes weight(in kg), height(in cm), age(in years), gender, 
physical activity(if you make mistake when fulfilling the physical activity information, you can see an explanation about them), 
then, return a body mass index, a nutritional status string and a table that shows a diet plan for each meal these are the breakfast, lunch, dinner and snack,
for seven days of the week.

When I coding it, I too much struggled to find correct information to the calculations, have fun. 

In the project directory, you can run: 

### 'python gui.py'
